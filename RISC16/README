INTRO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains some simple work involving the RISC16 Processor which is a common example for introductory computer architecture courses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this folder you will find a simple verilog core of the RISC16, along with an assembler written in C. This project was done mainly to become more fmailiar with the Altera Quartus IDE.

The CPU is simple with no pipelines or other complications, just a simple example for an introduction to Verilog. 

I hope to soon put more work into this and add a pipelined data path.

Enjoy!
